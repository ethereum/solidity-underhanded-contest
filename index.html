									<h2>Theme</h2>
									<p>In this year, we would like you to build a simple decentralized exchange where people can trade their hard-earned NFTs or DAO participation tokens.</p>
									<p>The rules of decentralized exchanges (at least the simple ones) are very easy and nothing can go wrong there, right?</p>
									<p>Build a decentralized exchange either with an automated market maker or a match-making mechanism where trades do not really work as expected.<br/>
									It is also fine to add a flaw to a token implementation you provide instead of to the exchange.</p>
									<p>Please stick to &quot;simplicity is key&quot;! The shorter the submission is, the better. Leave out ERC20 functions that are not needed for your submission, for example.</p>
									<p>It is nice to have a short &quot;story&quot; around your exchange in the readme file.
									Please also provide a short explanation about the flaw built into your submission, but put it into a different file like
									&quot;rugpull.txt&quot; or &quot;spoiler.txt&quot;, so judges can first have an unbiased look.</p>

									<h2>Prizes</h2>
									<p>The prizes are sponsored by several Ethereum-related security projects as well as the Ethereum Foundation. Each winner, starting with the 1st place, can choose a prize from the pool.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>1x Ticket to <a href="https://devcon.ethereum.org">Devcon6</a>.</li>
										<li>1x 1-year <a href="https://mythx.io/plans/">MythX Pro Plan</a> / 1x 1-year <a href="https://mythx.io/plans/">MythX Dev Plan.</a></li>
										<li>1x Automatic acceptance into <a href="https://solidified.io/">Solidified</a> auditor pool & a paid audit with Solidified.</li>
										<li>1x 1-year subscription to <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/defender/">OpenZeppelin Defender</a>.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Furthermore, the winners and all qualified submissions will receive a custom NFT.</p>

							<h2>Coding Brief & Guidelines</h2>
							<p>All you need to know about contest participation and submission!</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h4>Brief</h4>
									<p>Build a decentralized exchange that looks fair, but can be &quot;manipulated&quot;. This can be either by it leaking money, a specific account being able to withdraw all money or something else you can think of. The flaw can also be in a specific token implementation you provide instead of the exchange. The only requirement is that the flaw is hidden.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-gem"></span>
									<h4>Plausibility & Originality</h4>
									<p>Remember to consider plausibility. Code that drops down to inline assembly without any clear reason why will look immediately suspicious, no matter how cleverly written the assembly-level flaw is.<br><br>In addition to that it's needless to say that truly original ideas will receive more points than making use of already well known exploit/backdoor mechanisms.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-save"></span>
									<h4>Simplicity is key!</h4>
									<p>Submissions that are short and clean will be scored higher than those that are lengthy and complicated. It's easy to hide a vulnerability in complex and poorly written code; far harder to hide it in clean and simple code.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-clock"></span>
									<h4>Timeline</h4>
									<p>Make sure to send submissions before the end of the deadline.<br><br>
										Submissions open on 2022-01-xx.<br>
										Submissions close on 2022-03-xx.<br>
										Winners will be announced before <a href="https://devconnect.org">Devconnect Amsterdam</a>.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-lock-open"></span>
									<h4>Open-Source License</h4>
									<p>The entirety of your submission must be licensed under an open-source license. You must not submit anything that cannot be published.</p>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-code-branch"></span>
									<h4>Solidity Version</h4>
									<p>Please use <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases">Solidity</a> v0.8.0 or newer.</p>

										<h2>Submission & Participation</h2>
										<p>Please email your submissions before the deadline [2022-03-31] to <a href="mailto:sol_underhanded@ethereum.org">sol_underhanded@ethereum.org</a>. Entries should consist of a ZIP file containing a README describing your submission and how it works [spoilers included], and one or more Solidity files.<br><br>
										Each person can only enter one submission. If you want to make a team submission, nominate a single person to submit on your team’s behalf. Since entries will be forwarded to the judges and assessed anonymously, please do not include identifying information in the ZIP file.</p>
										<h4>Who can participate?</h4>
										<p>Anybody over the age of 18 can participate. Judges and organizers of this contest are excluded from participation. If your jurisdiction requires you to pay taxes on prizes or imposes other restrictions, please make sure to adhere to those. If taking part in such contests is prohibited in your area please adhere to your local laws.</p>

										<h2>About</h2>
										<p>Inspired by the <a href="http://www.underhanded-c.org/">Underhanded C Contest</a> and the first <a href="https://u.solidity.cc/">Underhanded Solidity Contest</a>, organized in 2017 by Nick Johnson, in 2020 the Solidity team decided that it is time for a revival. We hope this contest will get the traction it deserves in which case we could consider turning it into a recurring event.<br><br>
										The Solidity Underhanded Contest aims to:
										<ul>
											<li>Raise awareness about smart contract security.</li>
											<li>Uncover language design faults.</li>
											<li>Battle-test recently introduced language features and restrictions.</li>
											<li>Highlight anti-patterns in smart contact development.</li>
											<li>Establish new best practices for secure smart contract development.</li>
										</ul>
									A big thank you to <a href="https://diligence.consensys.net/">ConsenSys Diligence</a>, <a href="https://solidified.io/">Solidified</a>, <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/">OpenZeppelin</a>, and the <a href="https://ethereum.foundation/">Ethereum Foundation</a> for contributing prizes, supporting with judging and all their input!
